## üóÑ Database Setup 

The project's database was *developed to bootstrap a blog system in the easiest and fastest way possible.* You'll need to follow this database structure to test it, but **feel free to adapt and expand** it as needed‚Äîthis project was designed specifically for such use cases.

#### Users Table
The `users` table requires these fields:

- `id`: INT (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- `full_name`: VARCHAR(100)
- `username`: VARCHAR(50) (Unique)
- `email`: VARCHAR(100) (Unique)
- `password`: VARCHAR(255)
- `avatar`: VARCHAR(255)
- `birthday`: DATE
- `role`: ENUM('admin', 'editor', 'author')
- `created_at`: DATETIME
- `updated_at`: DATETIME

### Posts Table
Set up a `posts` table with these fields:

- `id`: INT (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- `title`: VARCHAR(255)
- `description`: TEXT
- `content`: TEXT
- `slug`: VARCHAR(255) (Unique)

## üìñ Overview

The **Vanilla PHP MVC Blog System** is a minimal yet powerful blog platform built from the ground up using pure PHP, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It's designed for developers who want a clean, dependency-free foundation to learn, extend, or deploy real-world applications. This project not only showcases professional-grade PHP development practices but also serves as a valuable resource for the community, making it an excellent addition to your portfolio for technical interviews and recruitment opportunities.

### üéØ Why Use This?

- Master MVC architecture in pure PHP.
- Understand routing, controllers, and views without framework magic.
- Build secure, scalable apps with full control.
- Showcase your skills in portfolios or interviews.

## üõ† Core Features

### MVC Architecture

- **Model**: Manages data and logic with PDO-based MySQL integration.
- **View**: Renders templates with reusable components and layouts.
- **Controller**: Handles requests and ties everything together.

### Routing

- Custom-built router with:
  - Dynamic parameters (e.g., `/posts/{id}`, `/posts/{slug}`).
  - Controller-method mapping (`Controller@method`).
  - Public routes: `/`, `/posts`, `/posts/{slug}`, `/login`.
  - Private routes: `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/users` (admin-only), `/admin/posts` (authenticated).
  - 404 handling and URL normalization.
